	<li>Away in a Manger</li>
	</h1>
	<h3 class="song"><em>Away in a manger
No crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus
Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
<br>
<br>
The cattle are lowing
The poor Baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus
No crying He makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my side
'Til morning is nigh
<br>
<br>
Be near me, Lord Jesus
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me, I pray
Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care
And take us to Heaven
To live with Thee there

    Shepherds, why this jubilee?
    Why your joyous strains prolong?
    What the gladsome tidings be
    Which inspire your heav地ly song?<span class="chorus">Chorus</span>
	<br>
	<br>
    Come to Bethlehem and see
    Him Whose birth the angels sing;
    Come, adore on bended knee,
    Christ the Lord, the newborn King.<span class="chorus">Chorus</span>
	<br>

<h1><li>Joy to the World!</li></h1>
<h3 class="song">
<em>
    Joy to the world, the Lord is come!
    Let earth receive her King;
    Let every heart prepare Him room,
    And heav地 and nature sing,
    And heav地 and nature sing,
    And heav地, and heav地, and nature sing.
<br>
<br>
    Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns!
    Let men their songs employ;
    While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
    Repeat the sounding joy,
    Repeat the sounding joy,
    Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy.
<br>
<br>
    No more let sins and sorrows grow,
    Nor thorns infest the ground;
    He comes to make His blessings flow
    Far as the curse is found,
    Far as the curse is found,
    Far as, far as, the curse is found.
<br>
<br>
    He rules the world with truth and grace,
    And makes the nations prove
    The glories of His righteousness,
    And wonders of His love,
    And wonders of His love,
    And wonders, wonders, of His love.

<h1><li>Jingle Bell Rock</li></h1>
<h3 class="song">
<em>
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
<br>
<br>
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
<br>
<br>
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh
<br>
<br>
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell..
That's the jingle bell..
That's the jingle bell rock!!

<h1><li>I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day</li></h1>
<h3 class="song">
<em>
 I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace of earth, good will to men.
<br>
<br>
 I thought how, as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along th'unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.
<br>
<br>
 And in despair I bowed my head:
"There is no peace on earth," I said,
"For hate is strong, and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men."
<br>
<br>
 Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
"God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail,
With peace on earth, good will to men."
